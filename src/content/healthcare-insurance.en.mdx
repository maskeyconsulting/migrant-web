    ### Mandatory Health Insurance

    In Qatar, your employer is legally required to provide you with health insurance. This insurance should cover basic medical services, ensuring you have access to healthcare when you need it.

<br />
### What Your Insurance Covers

    Typically, your health insurance will cover doctor visits, hospital stays, and emergency treatment. It may also cover some medications. However, it might not cover everything, so it's important to understand the details of your policy.
