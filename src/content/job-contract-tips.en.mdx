<SectionContainer title="Understanding Recruitment Agencies and Fees: What You Need to Know" slug="recruitment-agencies-fees">
  Going to Qatar for work is a big step, and understanding how recruitment agencies work is crucial for your safety and success. While Nepal has policies to protect you, it's important to be aware of the challenges you might face.
<br/>
**The "Free Visa, Free Ticket" Policy and What It Means for You**

In July 2015, the Nepali government put a policy in place called "Free Visa, Free Ticket." This policy was created to stop you from paying huge fees to get a job abroad. It states that your employer in Qatar should pay for your airline ticket and visa.

On top of that, recruitment agencies in Nepal are only allowed to charge you a maximum of NPR 10,000 (about USD $96) as a service fee. This fee should only be charged if your employer doesn't pay the agency's commission.

<br />

**The Reality: Why You Still Pay Too Much**

Even though the "Free Visa, Free Ticket" policy sounds good, many recruitment agencies don't follow it. It's common for workers to be charged much more than the legal limit, sometimes as high as USD $1,200.

To pay these illegal fees, you might have to:

- Take out high-interest loans, sometimes with interest rates up to 60% per year.
- Sell your personal belongings.

This puts you in debt even before you leave Nepal. This debt makes you very vulnerable, as you become desperate to earn back your money, which can lead to further problems in Qatar.

<br />

**Beyond Money: Other Tricks Agencies Use**

Recruitment agencies might also:

- Lie about your job description, working hours, or salary. This is called "contract substitution." You might be promised one job, but when you arrive in Qatar, the terms of your employment are completely different. This kind of deception is a serious form of human trafficking.
- Keep your passport. This is illegal and gives them control over you, making it hard for you to leave or complain.

Many workers are afraid to talk about the fees they paid because they fear punishment from the agents. It's also hard to get evidence because agencies often give you a receipt for the legal amount while charging you much more. You might also only deal with sub-agents in your village, making it difficult to identify or hold the main agency accountable.

<br />

**Why This Problem Continues**

The "Free Visa, Free Ticket" policy isn't working as it should. This is due to:

- Lack of strong oversight and monitoring by the Nepali government.
- Corruption within the recruitment industry.

This means that you, the migrant worker, carry almost all the financial and human rights risks.

Even with these challenges, there are steps you can take:

**In Nepal:** The Department of Foreign Employment (DOFE) is the official body responsible for regulating recruitment agencies. They also keep a list of agencies that have been blacklisted.

<br />
**In Qatar:** The Ministry of Labour has a mobile app where you can submit permit
extensions and file complaints directly against agencies and employers.
